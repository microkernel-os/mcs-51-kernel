## A kernal for MCS-51 Architecture


## What's MSC-51 Architecture 
    The Intel MCS-51 (commonly termed 8051) is a single chip microcontroller series 
    developed by Intel in 1980 for use in embedded systems.
    
    
    
    
##  FEATURES

#### Basic:
- 8-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and accumulator
- 8-bit registers (one 16-bit register with special move instructions)
- 8-bit data bus and 2Ã—16-bit address buses 
- program counter, data pointer 
- and related 8/11/16-bit operations 
  - Boolean processor with 17 instructions
  - 1-bit accumulator, 32 registers (4 bit-addressable 8-bit) and up to 144 special 1 bit-addressable RAM variables (18 bit-addressable 8-bit)
- Multiply, divide and compare instructions
- Four fast switchable register banks with eight registers each (memory mapped)
- Fast interrupt with optional register bank switching
- Interrupts and threads with selectable priority
- 128 or 256 bytes of on-chip RAM (IRAM)
- Dual 16-bit address bus; it can access 64 KB (65,536 locations) each of ROM (PMEM) and external RAM (XRAM)
- Four 8-bit bi-directional input/output ports, bit addressable
- UART (serial port)
- Two 16-bit counter/timers
